    question: "How long does it take to complete a design?",
    answer:
      "We know you're eager to unveil your amazing designs faster than you can say 'add to cart'! While we aim for a speedy delivery within 2-3 days, there are times when the design elves are working overtime, and it might take a smidge longer.  With our agency juggling approximately 50 Amazon A+ projects a week, you can bet your bottom dollar we're pros at this game. Your project is our top priority, and we'll make sure it's worth the (slightly extended) wait!",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer rush services for urgent?",
    answer:
      "We get it - sometimes you need designs faster than Amazon Prime delivers! We offer rush services for those 'drop-everything-and-design-now' moments. Just remember, while we'll move faster than a cheetah on caffeine, there's a small 'speedy service' fee involved.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer consultations or strategy sessions before starting a design project?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! Before we kick off any design project, we like to sit down and chat strategy. Think of it as our secret sauce for burying the competition and turning your customers into loyal fans. Best part? It's on the house! We're offering a free consultation call where we'll brainstorm ideas, share insights, and chart a course to Amazon success together.",
